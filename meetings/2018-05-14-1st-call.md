## What can we improve?
- Content level ranking - we should rank each meetup as beginners, advanced or expert in advanced.
- Upload presentations- ask and upload each meetup presentation.
- Record - record our meetups.
- More beginners content. We're too much focused on deep dive content.
- Slack - we should bring more traffic. For example invite participants to ask questions before and during each meetup on slack. Review AWS News from the slack bot.

## Think Big Ideas
- Upload content of every meet up and build a knowledge base over time.
- Enhance collaboration between participants. We need to think how?
- Round table - schedule more meetups with small groups and no agenda. Where everyone can come and talk.
- Hands on or workshops - more meet ups where everyone can try and learn staff.
- AWS News - start each meet up with AWS News.
- Twitter - we should experiment with twitter in order to promote our meetups.

## Community mission
- First time speakers - bring more speakers. Focus on first time speakers.
- Community activities - less focus on video or blog materials. More high quality content for meetups.
- Enable collaboration - more discussions, networking, etc. Through face to face or platforms like slack.
- More marketing through social media - main focus is to promote our events. Less focus on online content.

## Action items
- Create a shared doc for future agenda, speakers and locations pipeline. Make it more accessible and transparent
