# Community Committee

## Contributing

The [AWS User Group Israel](http://meetup.com/aws-il) is tasked with growing and sustaining AWS Community in Israel.
If you're reading this, you're already a part of that community and we'd love to
have your help!

If you're interested in participating in the Community Committee directly, you should
[create an issue](https://github.com/aws-ug-israel/community-committee/issues/new) asking to be a Guest in our next Community Committee meeting. We're doing a monthly call on Tuesday evenings (Israel Time).

> code commits !== the main means to contributions.

## Initiatives
If you're looking to get started with participating, the following are fairly straightforward initiatives that could use your help:
